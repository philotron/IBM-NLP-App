# IBM-NLP-App
This web application is the project result of an internship at IBM. The objective was to develop a matching algorithm that takes in a statement of work (SOW) and outputs fitting job profiles based on a given taxonomy of occupations. The latter was implemented through the combination of fuzzy matching, tf-idf vectors, and cosine similarity. Using the mentioned algorithm, a simple web application was created to showcase its capabilities. Finally, it was deployed to the IBM Cloud.
